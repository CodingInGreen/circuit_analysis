# Problem 5 - Resistivity and Conductvity

### Resistivity

Resistivity is a property unique to a material.

![Problem 5](resistivity-1-a.png)

p = resistivity
A = crosss-sectioal area
L = length
R = overall resistance of the material, as measured across its length

### Conductivity

Conductivity is the inverse of resistivity.

Conductivity is measured in siemens (S).

### Problem

With an ammeter and voltmeter, you measure th current drawn by a computer to be 1.5 Amps and the voltage entering to be 117 V. Ho wmuch power does the coputer consume? Can we say how much power is lost to head?

P = IV = (1.5A)(117V) = 176 W. 

Knowing how much power is lost to heating is practically impossible to measure without taking the computer apart.
